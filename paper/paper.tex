\begin{abstract}
For $0 \leq k \leq 6$, we give the minimum number of vertices $f(k)$ in a graph containing all
$k$-vertex graphs as induced subgraphs, and show
that $16 \leq f(7) \leq 18$.  For $0 \leq k \leq 5$, we also give the counts of
such graphs, as generated by brute-force computer search.  We give additional
results for small graphs containing all trees on $k$ vertices.

\section{Introduction}

Given a collection $\calF$ of graphs, graph $G$ is \emph{induced universal} for
$\calF$ if and only if each element of $\calF$ is an induced subgraph of $G$.
Graph $G$ is a \emph{minimal} induced universal graph for $\calF$ if it has as
few vertices as possible.  The problem of finding a minimal induced universal graph
of a family of graphs generalises the minimum common supergraph problem
\cite{DBLP:journals/computing/BunkeJK00}.

We write $f(k)$ to denote the order (that is, the
number of vertices) of a minimal induced universal graph for the family of all
graphs on $k$ vertices.  Moon showed that $f(k) \leq 2^{(k-1)/2}$
\cite{moon_1965}, and Alon showed that $f(k) = (1 + o(1))2^{(k-1)/2}$
\cite{alon2017asymptotically}.  There is an extensive literature on bounds on
the order of minimal induced universal subgraphs for many families of graphs;
see the references in \cite{alon2017asymptotically}.
However, to my knowledge the only
existing systematic attempt to find exact values for families of small
graphs is a Mathematics Stack Exchange answer by James Preen that presents results for families of small connected graphs obtained by brute-force search with the Maple programming language \cite{preen_math_se}.

This paper uses a brute-force approach similar to that of Preen to find minimal
induced universal graphs for families of small \emph{general} graphs.
Section~\ref{sec:method} describes our computer search method, including an
optimisation to reduce run times.  Sections~\ref{sec:results5} presents exact
values of $f(k)$ for $k \leq 5$ along with
the corresponding counts of minimal induced universal subgraphs.
Section~\ref{sec:f6} gives the value of $f(6)$ and and
Section~\ref{sec:f7} gives bounds on $f(7)$; in each of these sections, the lower
bound is proven and a graph obtained by heuristic search demonstrating the
upper bound is given.  Finally, Section~\ref{sec:trees} gives results for
families of trees.

\section{Generating all induced universal graphs}\label{sec:method}

Given $k$ and $n$,
I used a simple brute-force approach to find the set of
$n$-vertex graphs that are induced universal for the family $\calF(k)$ of all $k$-vertex
graphs.  Each possible $n$-vertex graph $G$ from Brendan McKay's lists of
graphs\footnote{\url{https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/graphs.html}} was
tested in turn.  I used a Python implementation of the McSplit
algorithm \cite{DBLP:conf/ijcai/McCreeshPT17} to test whether each $k$-vertex
graph is an induced subgraph of $G$.  Although the McSplit algorithm was designed for
the more general maximum common induced subgraph problem, it performs well on
the subgraph isomorphism problem if both input graphs are small.  (Although
I have described the application of this method to families of all graphs of a given order,
the method could easily be applied to any family $\calF$ of graphs, and indeed
Section~\ref{sec:trees} gives results from the application of this method
to families of trees.)

For those graphs $G$ that do not contain a copy of each element of $\calF(k)$,
it improves the speed of our algorithm if we can iterate over
$\calF(k)$ in an order that allows us to quickly reject $G$ by finding a graph
that is not an induced subgraph of $G$.  The approach I used was to sort
$\calF(k)$ in descending order of number of isomorphisms.  In particular, this
means that the clique $K_k$ and the independent set $I_k$ are the first two
graphs tested.

The full set of experiments described in this paper, run sequentially, required
took less than an hour complete on a laptop with an Intel Core i5-6200U CPU
and 8 GB RAM.\footnote{The code and
results from this paper, including lists of minimal induced universal graphs
in graph6 format, are available from
\url{https://github.com/jamestrimble/small-universal-graphs}}

\section{Results for \texorpdfstring{$k \leq 5$}{k<=5}}\label{sec:results5}

Table~\ref{tab:graphresults} shows, for $0 \leq k \leq 5$, the value of $f(k)$.
The table also shows $F(k)$, the number of minimal induced universal
graphs for the family of all $k$-vertex graphs.  To my knowledge, the value of
$f(5)$ and the values of $F(k)$ have not been published previously.

The values $f(1)$, $f(2)$ and $f(3)$ are equal to to the simple lower bound $2k
- 1$ given in a question by ``Chain Markov'' on Mathematics Stack Exchange
  \cite{math_se_question}.  The values $f(4)$ and $f(5)$ are equal to a lower
  bound given in a comment by ``bof'' on the same question: $f(k) \geq 2k$ if $k
  \geq 4$.  (For $k < 10$, this bound improves upon Moon's lower bound $f(k)
  \leq 2^{(k-1)/2}$.) To briefly summarise the proof, if $k \leq 2k$ then $G$
  must be a split graph (that is, a graph whose vertices can be partitioned
  into a clique and an independent set); therefore, $G$ cannot contain the
  cycle $C_4$ as an induced subgraph.  An example of an 8-vertex induced
  universal graph for the family of 4-vertex graphs was given by ``Chain
  Markov'' as a comment on the same question.

\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{r r r}
 \toprule
 $k$ & $f(k)$ & $F(k)$ \\ [0.5ex]

 3 & 5 & 5 \\

 \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{For each $k$, $f(k)$ is the minimum order of a graph containing all $k$-vertex graphs as
induced subgraphs, and $F(k)$ is the number of distinct $f(k)$-vertex graphs that contain
all $k$-vertex graphs as induced subgraphs.}

Figure~\ref{fig:graphs} shows examples of minimal induced universal graphs
for the families of all graphs with three, four and five vertices
respectively.

\caption{Minimal induced universal graphs for the families of all
graphs with 3, 4, and 5 vertices}
\label{fig:graphs}
\end{figure}

\section{\texorpdfstring{$f(6) = 14$}{f(6)=14}}\label{sec:f6}

This section shows that $f(6) = 14$.  We begin with the lower bound.
For $k \geq 6$, we can increase by 2 the lower bound by ``bof''.  In particular,
this means that $f(6) \geq 14$.

\begin{proposition}\label{f6proposition}
    $f(k) \geq 2k + 2$ for all $k \geq 6$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}

    Suppose that $G$ is an induced universal graph for the family of all graphs
    on $k$ vertices, and that $G$ has no more than $2k + 1$ vertices.  Graph
    $G$ must have $K_k$ and $I_k$ as induced sugraphs.  This clique and
    independent set may overlap by no more than one vertex, so their union must
    contain at least $2k - 1$ vertices.  Therefore it is possible to partition
    the vertices of $G$ into three sets: a clique $S_1$, an independent set
    $S_2$, and a third set $S_3$ containing at most 2 vertices.

    We will show that $G$ cannot contain as induced subgraphs both
    of the graphs in Figure~\ref{fig:boundproof}.  These graphs are complements
    of each other, and we refer to them as $H$ and $H'$ respectively.

\caption{If $k > 5$ and $G$ is a graph on $2k + 1$ or fewer vertices, then
$G$ cannot have as induced subgraphs all four of the following graphs: the
clique $K_k$, the independent set $I_k$, and
the two graphs shown. See the the proof of Proposition~\ref{f6proposition}}.
\label{fig:boundproof}
\end{figure}

    Let $G_1$ be an induced
    subgraph of $G$ that is isomorphic to $H$.  Since there are
    no edges between the two three-vertex cliques in $G_1$, it must be the case that the
    vertex set of at least one of these cliques does not intersect $S_1$.
    Since $S_2$ is an independent set in $G$, this clique must have exactly
    one vertex in $S_2$ and two vertices in $S_3$.  We can deduce, then, that
    $S_3$ contains exactly two vertices, and that these vertices are adjacent in $G$.

    Now consider graph $H'$.  Since $H'$ is an induced subgraph of $G$, it
    follows by taking complements of $H'$ and $G$ that $H$ is an induced
    subgraph of $G'$ (the complement of $G$).  We can repeat the argument
    of the previous paragraph with the roles of $S_1$ and $S_2$ reversed to
    show that the two vertices in $S_3$ must be adjacent in the complement of
    $G$, and therefore must not be adjacent in $G$.  Since we previously showed that
    these vertices are adjacent in $G$, we have a contradiction.
\end{proof}

To give an upper bound of 14 on $f(6)$, Figure~\ref{fig:adjmat14} shows the
adjacency matrix of a 14-vertex graph that is induced universal for the family
of all graphs on six vertices.  This was generated using a simple local search
algorithm.  We begin by generating a random graph on 14 vertices as follows.
We number the vertices from zero; the generator makes the
$k$ vertices numbered $0$ to $k-1$ a clique, and the $k$ vertices numbered $k-1$ to $2k-2$ an
independent set.  Each possible edge that is not involved in either the clique
or the independent set is added with probability $1/2$.
We then repeatedly ``flip'' the status of a random edge from present to absent
or vice versa, but always leave the large clique and independent set intact.
After each flip, we count the number of 156 graphs on 6 vertices that are isomorphic
to a subgraph of our 14-vertex graph.  If the most recent flip resulted in a decrease
in this number, we revert it.  After each 1000 flips, we restart the algorithm
with a new random graph.

\section{Bounds on \texorpdfstring{$f(7)$}{f(7)}}\label{sec:f7}

By Proposition~\ref{f6proposition}, we have $f(7) \geq 16$.  Figure~\ref{fig:adjmat18}
shows the adjacency matrix of an 18-vertex induced universal
graph for the family of all seven-vertex graphs. This was generated with 
the heuristic described in Section~\ref{sec:f6}, with 10000 rather than 1000
edge-flips permitted before each restart.

Thus we have $16 \leq f(7) \leq 18$.

\section{Trees}\label{sec:trees}

Table~\ref{tab:treeresults} gives the order $t(k)$ of a minimal induced universal graph for
the family of $k$-vertex trees, and the number $T(k)$ of such graphs.  Figure~\ref{fig:trees}
shows one of the 66 minimal induced universal graphs for the family of 6-vertex trees.

\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{r r r}
 \toprule
 $k$ & $t(k)$ & $T(k)$ \\ [0.5ex]
 \midrule
 0 & 0 & 1 \\
 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 2 & 2 & 1 \\
 3 & 3 & 1 \\
 4 & 5 & 2 \\
 5 & 7 & 18 \\
 6 & 9 & 66 \\
 \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{For each $k$, $t(k)$ is the minimum order of a graph containing all $k$-vertex trees as
induced subgraphs, and $T(k)$ is the number of distinct $t(k)$-vertex graphs that contain
all $k$-vertex trees as induced subgraphs.}
