Minimal number of nodes in a graph that contains every n-node graph as an induced subgraph.

Comments
A graph that contains as an induced subgraph every graph in a family F is called induced universal for F.

16<=a(7)<=18

Example
The 3-vertex graph with a single edge contains each of the two graphs on 2 vertices as an induced subgraph.  No graph with fewer than 3 vertices contains both of these graphs.  Therefore, a(2)=3.
